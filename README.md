# Fin16-The-AI-based-personalized-finance-application.
The Fin16 Project – An AI-Enhanced Custom Finance Application integrates finance, psychology, and artificial intelligence to create a system that helps users understand their financial behavior and improve decision-making. The application aims to uncover the underlying patterns in how individuals manage money psychologically.
Fin16 classifies users into 16 unique financial personality types, each representing a distinct combi-nation of spending styles, emotional tendencies, and decision-making approaches. This categorization ena-bles the system to deliver personalized insights and guidance aligned with each user’s mindset, goals, and financial outlook.
	Once identified, the user accesses an interactive AI-powered dashboard that serves as a personal hub for financial growth and self-development. The dashboard features several tools, including:
•	AI Assistant: Provides daily insights, tailored recommendations, and motivational prompts to en-hance financial awareness and emotional resilience.
•	Mood Monitor: Tracks emotional states and behavioral trends, linking feelings and financial deci-sions to encourage better self-control.
•	Micro-Courses: Delivers concise lessons on financial literacy, self-discipline, and emotional regula-tion, promoting continuous learning and growth.
	Developed using React, Node.js, Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and MySQL, Fin16 ensures a responsive, data-driven, and intelligent user experience. The AI component uses pattern recognition and adaptive learning to provide real-time feedback, helping users reflect on their actions and track their overall progress.
Beyond financial management, Fin16 focuses on self-awareness, behavioral transformation, and emotional balance, guiding individuals toward long-term financial and psychological well-being. By com-bining technology and human insight, Fin16 aspires to redefine personal finance as a journey of both eco-nomic and emotional growth.
